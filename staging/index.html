			Welcome to <strong>badges.community</strong>, a place for people interested in <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a> to come together in a Community of Practice. We’re interested in thinking differently in an effort to <em>Keep Badges Weird!</em>

    <p>
      We are a community with people who have invented and pioneered badge systems, technologies, standards and everything else badges. People in this community are front line educators, programme designers and learner advocates. We are the people who are motivated and influential in getting organisations to start thinking about upskilling in a non-traditional way. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a place in which contribution badges can recognise participation, creation, and reflection, as well as act as credentials. We are guided by the following definition of <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>: 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The community also maintains <a href="https://badge.wiki">Badge Wiki</a>, a knowledge base which helps those new to badges and those who want to explore more advanced topics. We encourage everyone to contribute to this project, and run regular ‘barn-raising’ sessions to co-ordinate work in this area.
