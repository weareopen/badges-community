# badges-community
Welcome to the Badges.community repo! This repo runs on Github pages and is a simple signposting area used to point to various badge community initiatives. The second iteration (August 2023) points to the Open Recognition is for Everybody community, projects, events and other communities that are active in the world of Open Recognition!     

> "Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit."

This community also maintains [Badge Wiki](https://badge.wiki/], works to [bridge the skills gap](https://www.openskillsnetwork.org/), commits to [bringing together learning and recognition](https://www.openrecognition.org/) and so much more.
