      This is a place in which contribution badges can recognise participation, creation, and reflection, as well as act as credentials. We are guided by the following definition of <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>: 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The community also maintains <a href="https://badge.wiki">Badge Wiki</a>, works to <a href="https://www.openskillsnetwork.org">bridge the skills gap</a>, commits to <a href="https://www.openrecognition.org">bringing together learning and recognition</a> and so much more.
